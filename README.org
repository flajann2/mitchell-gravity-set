** Rant
   I was going to do the GUI part in Ruby,
   but decided not to. Since the main computation
   will be in Rust anyway, why not do ALL of it
   in Rust? Maybe I'll do a Ruby front-end later,
   but the users will have to install Rust anyway.

** GUI and the Display

   The GUI shall be superimposed on the
   OpenGL 'canvas', and shall be activated 
   and deactived by keyboard keys, possibly
   the middle mouse button as well.

   Basically, the GUI shall address look like:

   |-------------------------+-----------------+--------|
   | Star 3 (all)            | ............... |        |
   | mass:______             | .             . | +      |
   | ............            | . S1          . |        |
   | Grav. Const __________  | .         S3  . | -      |
   |                         | .             . |        |
   | delta t ______________  | .    S2       . | tet    |
   |                         | .             . | cube   |
   | Resolution              | ............... | dodec  |
   | 2^3 4^3 8^3 ... 2048^3  |                 | sphere |
   |                         | # Stars _______ |        |
   | Escape Radius _______ r |                 |        |
   |                         |                 |        |
   |-------------------------+-----------------+--------|

   The Star box itself are OpenGL 3D-rendered "stars" that can
   be manipulated by the mouse. The pressing of the shift
   key will result in the dragging of a Star to a different
   location in the 2D plane it's in.
